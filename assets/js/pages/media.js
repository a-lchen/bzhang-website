      Aug. 15, 2018, a paper with Yuan-Pei Yang accepted for publication in ApJL <a target="_blank" class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05170">(Here)</a>. This paper suggests that the ultimate synchrotron "line of death" is at Fnu ~ nu^{2/3} rather than nu^{1/3}. However, in order to achieve this harder spectrum, one needs to have significant anisotropy in the emission region.

      Feb. 26, 2014, Uhm & Zhang, "Fast cooling synchrotron radiation in a decaying magnetic field and gamma-ray burst emission mechanism", accepted for publication in Nature Physics (<a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2704">here</a>). In this paper, we overcome the standard fast-cooling problem of GRB prompt emission, and suggest that the famous phenomenological "Band" function of GRB prompt emission with a mysterious low-energy photon index around -1 could be simply due to synchrotron emission in a varying magnetic field. This model requires a relatively large emission radius, as is expected in the "ICMART model" (<a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="zy11.pdf">here</a>) of GRB prompt emission.
