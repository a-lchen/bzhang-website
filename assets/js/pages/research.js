I am a theoretical astrophysicist. My research focuses on understanding the underlying physics of the high energy universe, including systems containing black holes of different scales and neutron stars of different species, relativistic jets launched from these systems as well as their interaction with the ambient medium. <br> <br>

Most of my research papers are dedicated to understanding gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most luminous explosions in the universe, but my publications also cover a wide range of topics in astrophysics, including gamma-ray and radio pulsars, magnetars, active galactic nuclei, tidal disruption events, white dwarfs, neutrinos and cosmic ray physics, dark matter, strange quark stars, etc. Lately, I am actively working in two emerging, exciting fields in astrophysics: multi-messenger (gravitational wave sources and their electromagnetic counterparts) astrophysics, and the physics of mysterious fast radio bursts (FRBs). <br><br>

  <p class="grey-text">
    On Feb. 11, 2016, Advanced LIGO team announced the discovery of the first astrophysical gravitational wave (GW) source, GW 150914. This marked the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. Detecting possible electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of GWs is the next challenging task. When detected, the astronomy will enter the full multi-messenger era.
    <br>
    <br>
    My group have been developing theoretical models for the EM counterparts of GWs.
    <br>
    <br>
    NASA's Fermi GBM team announced the discovery of a putative gamma-ray transient coincident with GW 150914 (dubbed GW 150914-GBM), which occurred ~0.4 s after the merger event and lasted ~ 1s. I have developed a model to interpret this event by invoking at least one charged black hole in the merging system. The same model also gives a possible interpretation to some Fasr Radio Bursts (FRBs). This paper can be found here. See Quanta Magazine and AAS NOVA for further discussion of the model.

  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio bursts discovered in 2007. Their origin remains unknown, even though recently one of them (the only that is observed to emit repeating bursts, dubbed FRB 121102) was localized to a star forming galaxy at z=0.193. This established a cosmological origin of at least this one event. It is widely believed that other FRBs are also from cosmological distances, even though whether there exists a sub-category of non-repeating ones is not clear.
  <br>
  <br> Together with my collaborators, I am actively working in this emerging new field.
  <br>
  <br> Recently, together with Duncan Lorimer (discoverer of the first FRB), Sarah Burke-Spolaor from West Virginia University and Edo Berger from Harvard University, I have organized the first major meeting in FRBs, i.e. <a href="http://aspen17.phys.wvu.edu/">the 2017 Winter FRB Conference</a> at Aspen Center for Physics. The conference hosted about 80 scientists over the world to discuss the nature of these mysterious bursts. The event was reported in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/astronomers-grapple-with-new-era-of-fast-radio-bursts-1.21557">Nature magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fast-radio-bursts-are-astronomy-rsquo-s-next-big-thing/">Scientific American</a>.

  In recent years, I spend most of my time on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the intense bursts of gamma-rays coming from the deep space. Being stellar scale events located at cosmological distances, GRBs make unique connections between different branches of astrophysics, including stellar astronomy, compact star physics, interstellar medium astronomy, galactic astronomy, and cosmology. Being most violent explosions in the universe, GRBs are targets of the electromagnetic telescopes of all wavelengths (radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-rays, MeV gamma-rays, GeV gamma-rays and even TeV gamma-rays) as well as non-electromagnetic detectors (high energy neutrinos, gravitational waves, and ultra-high energy cosmic rays). For a general introduction of GRBs and recent developments in the field, please read my recent review articles
